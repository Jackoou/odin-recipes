        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>These Feta Cheese Foldovers are delicious for snacks or appetizers when you have guests around. Feta always reminds me of holidays in Greece. These salty cheese treats remind me of the pastry snacks you get in little corner shops all around the Greek islands.</p>
        
        <p>Start by blending feta cheese, green onions, and egg to make the filling. Cut the pastry into squares and place filling in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water, fold the pastry over to form a triangle and press the edges together firmly with a fork to seal. Brush the pastries with egg yolk mixture and bake in the oven until golden brown. These parcels taste best served warm or at room temperature.</p>
