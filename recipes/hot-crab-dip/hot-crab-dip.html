        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These things are very hard to prove, or, more importantly to someone like me, disprove: But it’s with great confidence that I’m calling this “THE best hot crab dip.” It just is. In fact, this dip is so good, it even works nicely with the cheap canned crab you find next to the tuna fish and chopped clams. If a hot shellfish dip isn’t your thing, pretty much any chopped up protein will do just fine. By the way, if times are really tough, you don’t have to add anything. </p>

        <p>My mom used to make an appetizer for parties that consisted of cream cheese smothered in cocktail sauce and topped with a handful of bay shrimp. This, surrounded by lots of saltine crackers, was always a big hit. But sometimes we couldn’t afford the shrimp, so she’d do the exact same thing without the shrimp. And it was still great. So, if crab is not a financially viable choice, you could just serve this sans seafood, and somewhere my mom would be smiling. Anyway, no matter what you use, a hot cheesy dip is always a big hit at any party, and I really do hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy! </p>
